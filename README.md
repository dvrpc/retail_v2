# Suburan Retail Districts (2021 update)

An update to the existing [Suburban Retail Districts](https://www.dvrpc.org/webmaps/retail/) web map
that will improve performance, update data and information, and streamline the user experience. We will be moving away from the existing Leaflet platform into a custom solution built with mapboxgl js and custom vector tiles.
